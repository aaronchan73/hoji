# Hoji 

*Hoji (保持) - Retention*

A pomodoro-style flashcard app made in Java. 

Hoji is a pomodoro flashcard app allowing users to iterate through a series of flashcards and stimulate memorization of course material. Users can add their flashcards with a question, answer, and level of difficulty, and start a pomodoro timer of 25 minutes to time their study session. When practicing with the flashcards, users are prompted with the question and can reveal the correct answer when desired. Users can indicate that they got the question right, which will remove the flashcard from the pile, or wrong, which will repeatedly add the flashcard to the pile until the user gets it right.
