When practicing with the flashcards, users are prompted with the question and can reveal the correct answer when desired. Users can indicate that they got the question right, which will remove the flashcard from the pile, or wrong, which will repeatedly add the flashcard to the pile until the user gets it right. Users also get the option to have a timed study session, by clicking the play button to start the 25 minute countdown timer.
